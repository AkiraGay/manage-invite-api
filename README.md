# ManageInvite API

## Documentation ✏️

Some endpoints can be accessed using a **Guild Token**. You can get it using the **[ManageInvite Dashboard](https://manage-invite.xyz)**, in your guild settings. You can also read the **[API documentation](https://developer.manage-invite.xyz)** to learn how to use it!

## Goals and features ✨

The ManageInvite API is designed to allow developers to create their own bots using our database, or to update their guild settings automatically. This is the **public** API, accessible using a **Guild Token**. The second job of the ManageInvite API is to make the dashboard working. It is a React application and therefore the actions trigger an API request, usually using a **User Token**. The last thing the API does is to handle the PayPal payments.
